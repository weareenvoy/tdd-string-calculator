## String Calculator

The string calculator is another TDD kata. The overarching concept is that a string of numbers is sent to the class and those numbers are summed.

### Description of each step in the process

There isn’t so much of an explanation in this process, mostly because I’m learning this one as I go. What I do know is this:

We have a class `StringCalculator`, and we’re writing up the tests for the function `StringCalculator::add(string $numbers)`. We’ll get more detailed specs as we go!

#### Test #1 -- Summing a Small String

Follow along with the code completely by following the commits in `test/1-sum-small-string`.

Our first task is to prove our method can sum from 0 to 2 numbers in a given string. No numbers means we return 0.

Let’s write the first test!

```php
<?php

class StringCalculatorTest extends \PHPUnit\Framework\TestCase
{
    /**
     * @test
     */
    public function sums_an_empty_string()
    {
        $calc = new StringCalculator;

        $result = $calc->add('');

        self::assertSame(0, $result);
    }
}
```

If you followed along with the Bowling Kata, you know where this is going. Let’s run the test!

```
Error: Class 'StringCalculator' not found
